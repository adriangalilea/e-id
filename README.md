- **Easy Setup**
- **No data storage** Literally, we don't even use a database, your data is compressed and encoded which ends up being the url itself, try it out yourself and inspect the code if you wish, after extensively testing(2 hours and chatgpt) several compression and encoding methods, and arrived at the conclusion that base64-url and brotli.
